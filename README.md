## Goals and Wins
The goal of this project was to get comforatble writing tests for javascript inorder to test the functionality of the code we were writing. A big win for me during this project was seeing all of my javascript skills come together to quickly and effieciently write code. Additionally, my abilities to effectively psuedocode allowed me to write tests before writing functions follwoing TDD.
